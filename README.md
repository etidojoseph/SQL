# Welcome to My SQL Project Portfolio! 
### This repository contains a project where I used SQL to analyze a Superstore dataset. 
### The focus was on extracting information on pricing, stock levels, and other key statistics for different product categories. 
> Feel free to review the SQL queries and see how I applied data analysis techniques to gain insights from the dataset. 
>If you have any questions or would like to discuss the project further, feel free to reach out!
